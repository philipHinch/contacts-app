# Contacts App

This is a personal **React** project focused on form handling and controlled inputs.

Contacts App will allow you to store your contact's information, it will also allow you to filter through them when searching for a specific contact and it will also allow you to sort the contacts when clicking on the sort arrows.

I used useEffect and useState for state management. 

This app is fully responsive.
